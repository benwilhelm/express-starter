BenWilhelm's Express Starter
============================

This is a bit of boilerplate for building apps in Node/Express/MongoDB. This is
an attempt to distil some of my existing practices into a reusable starting
place and as such is an evolving project. built and maintained for my own
convenience, and released under the MIT License. Use it if it's convenient for
you, and feel free to offer suggestions or patches.

The starter kit currently includes:
----------------------------------

* Express
* Basic authenticated user model
* Authentication with [Passport](http://passportjs.org), including middleware
  for Basic, Local, and HMAC strategies
* Optional middleware to either require SSL or simply redirect to SSL
* Grunt tasks to test and lint code
* Test stack using mocha and
